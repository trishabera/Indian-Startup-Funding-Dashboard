1.	Introduction: This dashboard explores the Indian startup ecosystem by visualizing funding data from 2015 to 2020. It highlights how funding patterns have evolved over time, what industries and cities attracted the most capital, and the investment stages where startups raised the most. The data was cleaned in Excel and visualized in Tableau, creating an end-to-end data analysis pipeline that reflects real-world challenges like inconsistent categories, missing data, and text-heavy columns.
